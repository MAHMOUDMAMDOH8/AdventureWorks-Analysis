# AdventureWorks-Analysis
Data Collection: I gathered relevant data from microsofet AdventureWorks

Data Transformation: Using Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis.

Data Modeling: I designed a logical data model, establishing relationships between different data tables and make a star schema

DAX Implementation: I employed DAX to create calculations that provide deeper insights into the data, such as revenue growth, year-over-year comparisons, and more.

DimDate Creation: Through DAX, I constructed a dynamic DimDate table, enabling time-based analysis and visualizations.

Visual Dashboard: I developed an interactive dashboard with intuitive visualizations that allow users to explore data trends effortlessly.

Report Generation: The project culminates in a comprehensive report that presents findings, insights, and recommended actions.
